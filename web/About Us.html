                <h3> OUR MISSION </h3>
                <p> Getting Bed in Hospital in this pandemic has become issue due not only for Covid Patients but also for
                    other Patients. To solve this problem we can take use latest technology. Today, We have different apps
                    in our mobile for different things like Booking Cabs, Train, even seat in a Restaurants. Therefore we
                    have tried to make App which will Help Patients to Book Bed in Hospital for there treatment. The
                    Objective of Our Hospital Bed Provider App is similar to its name that is provide efficient bed
                    management system for Hospitals and Patients.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> In this Pandemic, covid patient or its relatives have to go for searching bed in Hospital or Covid
                    Centers. But going out and searching is not only time consuming but also risky. We have seen many of them losing
                    their life because not find Hospital in Time. There are many App and Website to find Hospitals but none
                    of them provide actual bed availability and also feature to book bed in hospital.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> The HOSPITAL BED PROVIDERS will record all the data regarding the total number of beds available in the
                    hospital, And total beds occupied, and total beds unoccupied. It must also record the number of patients
                    who are getting treated in the hospital and How many days that patient will require the bed. It must also
                    record how many patients can the management admit so that there is no excess of patients than the number of
                    beds available in the hospital.
